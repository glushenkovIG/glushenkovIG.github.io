	<h2> EXPERIENCE </h2>
		<i>

			<div id="left" align="left">
				I like studying, working with people, solving difficult problems, coding. Can speak two foreign languages, Deutch and English. I am good at physics, math, engineering, and communication with people.
				 Currently I'm very interested in cryptography and the blockchain technology. <br>

				Have taken part in two blockchain hackathons:
				<ul>
				<div id="hacks">
					<li> LAToken Hackathon: <br>
							With my colleague have created a Smart Contract implemented in Solidity that
							 allows to estimate the values of and sell different kinds of assets. <br> Have taken 4-th place.
					</li><br>

			 		<li> Binary District Hackathon: <br>
							We have created a web-wallet for the EnryptoTel company. It communicates with the EncryptoCore protocol and allows signing transactions without having to enter the private key manualy.								During this hackhathon we have also designed an online IDE for the EncryScript language.
							<br>
							<a href="https://github.com/samkrew/es-editor"> IDE </a> <br>
							<a href="https://github.com/KarovInal/encryWallet"> EncryCoreWallet </a>
				 	</li>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div id="right" align="left">
				And some other hackhathons:<br>
				<div id="hacks">
				<ul>

					<li> Global Changers: <br>
						Developed a client-supporting bot system for the Megaphone company. For demonstration we have used Telegram API. <br>
						This bot can register new users, show balance and all contracts, add and delete new service plan, connect with human operator and so on.
						Have taken the 1st place.
						<br>
						<a href="https://github.com/raid-7/ExampleSupportBot"> SampleSupportBot </a>
					</li><br>

					<li> S7 Airlines: <br>

							Desined and developed a site for football fans in 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia.
							We have trained a recursive neural network and analysed more than 20000 football matches since 1968.
						 	Then we predicted the results of the games in the championship and created a graph with all the matches and probabilities of wining.
						 	<br>
						 	All the usefull information like map with stadiums,
						   information about every stadium and about the bars near it, has been presented to the users.
							Moreover, the information on all the team members from each of the 32 commands was also presented.
							There was also a quiz "Try to guess",
							 where you have given a photo of famous footballer,
							  and you needed to guess the country he is from.<br>
